# daily. | your accountability assistant

## Thesis
We want to help people make better decisions. We believe we all have a lot of wasted information in our lives, especially founders.
We hold all these tasks and ideas in our internal monologue. We rarely set clear goals. When things go wrong, we've already lost the context to learn from it.

**daily.** helps you externalise this. Through short phone calls, you clarify your priorities, establish clear goals and schedule the steps to get you there. Then **daily.** can call you up to nudge you at the right time. And every day you talk, you build a valuable information store for self-growth.

*Think of the combination of a best friend, a coach and Alexa, that actually works, 24/7, for you, and no-one else.*

## Focus

For early-stage founders and freelancers the cost of failing to set track and learn from clear goals is success vs failure. The ROI of coaching is [proven](https://www.coachhub.com/app/uploads/2021/12/US_ROI-of-Coaching.pdf), but Â£100/h fees make this an infrequent interaction, leading to a loss of huge amounts of data and insights.
At a fraction of the cost, we can give visionaries the structure and support they need to pursue their dreams.

## Team

[**Lachlan Chavasse**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lchavasse/): Ran product at **Stimy AI**, a pre-seed edtech startup building the next generation of maths education growing to 20k MAU with ~5% Week 4 retention. Previously built a liqueur business. Cambridge & Imperial Alum.

**My Why?** I found myself constantly looking back wondering why I made the decisions I did, forgetting the context and ideas I had at the time. I've dabbled in journaling, but it's never been enough to truly learn and grow.

## Market
- UK: 4.1 million single person businesses ([FSB](https://www.fsb.org.uk/media-centre/uk-small-business-statistics)) - 4.3 Mn freelancers
- US: ~10x the UK market
- Freelancers 2x more likely to implement AI tools in their workflow ([Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/research/freelance-forward-2023-research-report#:~:text=frequently%20in%20their%20work%3A%2020,of%20all))
- At a $20/month subscription 5% of this is a billion dollar opportunity
- Scalability into other languages and regions is straightforward

## Proof
- [**Boardy**](https://www.boardy.ai/) has demonstrated adoption of voice ai, but does not present clear value or privacy
- [**Epiphany**](https://epiphanyvoice.io/) (#1 product hunt) shows desire to take notes in all scenarios, but moves context elsewhere

## Competition
- **Document Based Tools (Notion, Obsidian):** Serve as knowledge base, but not habit building or reactive.
- **Journaling apps:** Too many features yet missing consistent habit-building prompts - don't provide immediate value
- **Voice assistants (Siri/Gemini/Alexa):** Largely reactive and lack context retention
- **AI therapy/coaching:** Sporadic guidance without sustained support
- **AI wearables (e.g. [Bee](http://bee.computer/), [Omi](https://www.omi.me/), [Gobi](https://joingobi.com/) etc.):** Innovative but conflict with the growing desire for offline spaces - little value from reflective process
- **Specialised models ([Sesame](https://www.sesame.com/), Pi ([Inflection AI](https://inflection.ai/))):** exciting space - can use their APIs
